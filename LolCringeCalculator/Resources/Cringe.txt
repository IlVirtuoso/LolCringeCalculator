A team level advantage = the average level of your team minus the average level of the enemy team. The value can be decimal and is capped at 3.
While your team has a level advantage, your minions deal bonus damage to enemy minions equal to 5% + 5% per turret advantage in their lane, all multiplied by your team's level advantage.
Bonus damage = (5% + (5% × Turret advantage)) × Team level advantage
Maximum bonus damage = (5% + (5% × 3)) × 3 = 60%
While your team has a level advantage, your minions take flat reduced damage from enemy minions equal to 1 + 1 per turret advantage in that lane, with the turret advantage bonus multiplied by the team's level advantage.
Damage reduction = 1 + (Level advantage × Turret advantage)
Maximum damage reduction = 1 + (3 × 3) = 10
Nexus turrets do not count as lane turrets.
